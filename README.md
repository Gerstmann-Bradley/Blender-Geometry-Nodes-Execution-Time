The main goal of this add-on is to make it easy to check execution time in the node editor. Otherwise, you would have to pan through your node tree all the way to the Group Output.
This information, similar to whatâ€™s shown on the Group Output, will instead be displayed consistently in the upper-left corner of the node editor.
